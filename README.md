# Linux System Monitor

This repo contains the final project of the 2nd course of the Udacity Nanodegree. 

This is an interactive Linux process-viewer (similar to the htop) that shows a frequently updated list of the processes running on a computer.


## Requirements
- Compiler support for C++17
- Cmake installed
- ncurses library `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

## Get started
```
git clone https://github.com/Agnieszka1994/Linux-System-Monitor
cd Linux-System-Monitor/
mkdir build && cd build/
cmake ..
make
./monitor
```

## Sample usage
**The real time view upon startup.**
